📚 Learning-First Development Philosophy

This project is intentionally built as a learning project, not a speed or production project.

The goal is deep understanding, not copy-pasting or shipping fast.

If something “just works” but I don’t understand it, it’s not done yet.

🎯 Primary Goal

Learn how everything works under the hood

Build confidence writing code from scratch

Strengthen problem solving and debugging skills

Develop intuition, not dependency on generated code

🧠 How I Use AI (Guardrails)

AI is a coach, not a code generator.

When asking for help, AI should:

Guide me step-by-step

Suggest small next actions

Explain concepts clearly

Use pseudocode or skeletons first

Provide hints before solutions

Prefer small snippets over full files

AI should not:

Generate full features or entire files unless explicitly requested

Solve problems I haven’t attempted yet

Hide complexity I should learn

If I truly want the full solution, I will explicitly say:

“Show me the full implementation.”

✍️ How I Build Features
Workflow

Break feature into tiny steps

Attempt implementation myself first

Debug and reason through errors

Ask for hints only if stuck

Reflect on what I learned

Iteration Ladder

Features should grow gradually:

v0 → hardcoded prototype

v1 → state & logic

v2 → real data/API/storage

v3 → polish & UX

🧩 Coding Rules

Write core logic myself

Avoid unnecessary libraries

Understand the “manual way” before abstractions

Keep functions small and readable

Prefer clarity over cleverness

Comment why, not what

📦 Libraries Policy

Before adding a library, ask:

Do I understand how to build this manually?

Does this library save meaningful time or complexity?

Will it be easy to debug later?

If yes → add it
If not → build it myself first

🧪 Definition of Done (per feature)

A feature is complete only if:

✅ Works as expected

✅ Handles basic edge cases

✅ I can explain how it works out loud

✅ I could rebuild it without copying

✅ Includes a small test or manual checklist

📓 Learning Log

After each session, add notes to NOTES.md:

What I built

Problems I hit

How I solved them

New concepts learned

Things still confusing

This reinforces retention and builds intuition.

🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Blind copy/paste

Overengineering early

Adding libraries too soon

Skipping fundamentals

Asking for full solutions immediately

Building too many features at once

✅ Success Criteria

Success looks like:

I understand every file in this project

I can explain architecture without looking

I can rebuild parts from memory

Debugging feels easier over time

My coding speed improves naturally

Reminder:
Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.
Learning compounds. Shipping can wait.

If you'd like, I can next tailor this specifically for your Expo + TypeScript mobile app setup and add sections like folder structure, state management rules, and component patterns to follow.
